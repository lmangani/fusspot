Fusspot is a learning engine I've been meaning to write for 20-odd years. Its only now that it has become relevant as I am building [nodebots](http://nodebots.io/).

Fusspot is non-deterministic, you can train it to be biased towards certain responses with training and patience, but it will just as likely learn on its own and do whatever it likes.
